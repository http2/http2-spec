# Summary

Mark Nottingham is the Document Shepherd and Working Group Chair. Barry Leiba is the responsible Area Director.

This specification defines HPACK, a compression format for efficiently representing HTTP header fields, to be used in HTTP/2.

We intend this to be published as a Proposed Standard.

# Review and Consensus

We have enjoyed active participation from a broad community, including browser vendors, intermediaries (such as CDN and proxy vendors), server vendors and protocol library authors; this includes both commercial vendors and open source libraries.

Our current implementation list is at:
  https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations
  
Additionally, we have had participation and review from the non-implementing HTTP community itself. We have substantial external interest from the Web performance community as well.

We have also coordinated with the W3C, giving them regular updates through the liaison and the TAG.

Process-wise, we were chartered to do this work in August 2012, with a submission deadline of November 2014. We have treated that date seriously, so as to bound the commitment of the developers and implementers involved. As a result, we had a fairly high frequency of interim meetings (six in two years), used both to discuss issues and to hold interop events.
