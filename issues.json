While imperfect, these kinds of rules would at least handle the inadvertent DoS attack of a buggy client, and some intentional DoS attacks."

However, the client is required to send WINDOW_UPDATE frames to enable the receipt of packets from the server.\r\n\r\nThe same problem applies to PRIORITY.  Re-prioritization might be desirable for a stream that you have half-closed.  (For instance, it might be good to down-prioritize a GET after completing the request.)\r\n\r\nThe obvious workaround just creates a stalemate.  A client can't just retain the stream in the open state until it sees the FINAL flag from a server.  That encourages the same solution on the server, which leads to neither peer closing the connection.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the most pragmatic solution to this is to permit the sending of certain types of frames on half-closed streams."

Doing so would effectively reserve the stream id (in the same general manner PUSH_PROMISE does).\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this approach are:\r\n\r\n1. It eliminates any possible confusion and complexity about when to use HEADERS+PRIORITY vs. HEADERS\r\n2.

There is no prescribed mechanism for rolling out support for new standard frame types vs. private use frame types.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:\r\n\r\nOne approach we can take to dealing with this is to segment the 8-bit frame type namespace into two distinct categories and reserve a limited number of frame types from each for \"private use\". That is,\r\n\r\n0xxxxxxx => Control Frames\r\n1xxxxxxx => Data Frames\r\n\r\nControl Frames (0x00-7F) are always hop-by-hop and are not subject to flow control. Frame types 0x6B-7F would be reserved for \"private use\", meaning that these types could not be registered within the IANA registry. \r\n\r\nData Frames (0x80-FF) are always end-to-end and are subject to flow control. Frame types 0xEB-FF would be reserved for \"private use\". \r\n\r\nThe frame type of the existing DATA frame would change from 0x00 to 0x80, all other existing frame types would remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis approach gives us a clear way of dealing with extension frames, flow control, etc without introducing undue complexity.\r\n"

Any endpoint can initiate and half-close a fully unidirectional stream that does not require any action or acknowledgement from the receiving peer. Once half-closed, these remain in a constant half-closed state with the receiving peer having the option of sending frames for that stream at any time for the full duration of the session.\r\n\r\nB. An endpoint MUST NOT exceed the maximum concurrent streams limit set by it's peer and that half-closed streams in any direction count towards this limit.\r\n\r\nC. Unless I missed it somewhere, clients are not required to half-close PUSH_PROMISE streams.\r\n\r\nThe potential problem here is simple:\r\n\r\nIf a client sets a limit of 4 concurrent streams, and the server initiates 4 separate PUSH_PROMISE streams that the server half-closes but that are never half-closed by the client, the server not be able to initiate new push streams for the duration of the session. \r\n"

That is, a client (or intermediary ?) can safely retry an non-idempotent request.\r\n\r\nThis gets around the retry prohibition in http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging-22#section-6.3.1\r\n\r\nThis needs to be better explained, perhaps with a new section in the HTTP usage section.\r\n\r\nSee thread starting at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2013JanMar/1353.html"

    "body": "This issue is to track whether the client should advertise its settings (e.g. contents of SETTINGS frame) as part of the Upgrade GET (e.g. as HTTP/1.1 headers in the GET request).\r\n\r\nNormally, the first HTTP/2.0 frame the client emits is the SETTINGS frame.  This means the server will receive the client's settings before getting the  SYN_STREAM from the client.  However, in the Upgrade Dance the server receives the GET and has to respond with a 101 HTTP/1.1 response followed by the HTTP/2.0 SYN_REPLY.\r\n\r\nThe ugliness here is that the server will be in a situation where it has to send the SYN_REPLY (and possibly DATA frames and possibly start push streams) without knowing the client's settings.  This means the server may blow the client’s flow control buffers, or emit a pushed stream even though the client is incapable of processing pushed streams, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we include the settings as part of the initial Upgrade GET then\r\n1) Server receives the pre-requisite initials settings and the initial GET request in a single package.  Makes life simpler.\r\n2) Brings us to parity with the SSL route where the server will have the cilent's SETTINGS before it starts working on the initial request."
