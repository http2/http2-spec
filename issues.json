Are new unsupported frame types subject to flow control? How can we differentiate new control frame types vs. data frame types?\r\n\r\n3. There is no prescribed mechanism for rolling out support for new standard frame types vs. private use frame types.\r\n\r\nRecommendation:\r\n\r\nOne approach we can take to dealing with this is to segment the 8-bit frame type namespace into two distinct categories and reserve a limited number of frame types from each for \"private use\". That is,\r\n\r\n0xxxxxxx => Control Frames\r\n1xxxxxxx => Data Frames\r\n\r\nControl Frames (0x00-7F) are always hop-by-hop and are not subject to flow control. Frame types 0x6B-7F would be reserved for \"private use\", meaning that these types could not be registered within the IANA registry. \r\n\r\nData Frames (0x80-FF) are always end-to-end and are subject to flow control. Frame types 0xEB-FF would be reserved for \"private use\". \r\n\r\nThe frame type of the existing DATA frame would change from 0x00 to 0x80, all other existing frame types would remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis approach gives us a clear way of dealing with extension frames, flow control, etc without introducing undue complexity.\r\n"

It is likely that many design choices will be made based on the assumption that the protocol runs atop TCP and not some other transport protocol.\r\n\r\nWe should decide if the HTTP/2.0 specification is written exclusively for TCP or whether we want to pay lip service to protocol agnosticism.  Note that exclusivity does not preclude the use of other protocols in a later specification, it just removes one axis of freedom in the design."
